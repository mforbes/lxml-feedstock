  summary: Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt.
  description: |
    The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2 and
    libxslt. It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature
    completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API,
    mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API.
